                Authentic Relating Games were created to give you a playbook for
                how to begin relating on an authentic level.

                Often communication starts and stops because we feel unsure
                about how to approach it, what to say, or what to ask. Turning
                communication into a game provides a guiding structure and set
                of agreements for everyone involved. This removes a lot of the
                stress and anxiety from connection, and adds in an inviting
                element of play.
