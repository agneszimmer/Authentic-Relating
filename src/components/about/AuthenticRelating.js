        <h5>
          Authentic Relating Games were created to give you a playbook for how
          to begin relating on an authentic level.
        </h5>
        <p>
          Often communication starts and stops because we feel unsure about how
          to approach it, what to say, or what to ask. Turning communication
          into a game provides a guiding structure and set of agreements for
          everyone involved. This removes a lot of the stress and anxiety from
          connection, and adds in an inviting element of play.
        </p>
        <h5>
          Authentic Relating Games (played with 2 or more people) are designed
          to take you from:
        </h5>
        <p>Surface level answers to sharing whatâ€™s really going on </p>
        <p>Feeling disconnected to feeling a real bond</p>
        <p>
          Not knowing what to say to a connected in-flow conversation Lack of
          understanding to gaining helpful insights about each other
        </p>
        <h5>
          Playing these games help build skills for any relationship: Romantic
          partnerships, families, roommates, friends, community groups, teams,
          and clientele.
